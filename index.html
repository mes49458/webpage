		<h2> Golden Retrievers </h2>
		<p>The Golden Retriever is without a doubt the best dog breed in the world. I know this because I have had over ten golden retrievers in my life. My first dogs name was Belle; we got her when I was around six years old. When I was eight years old we decided to breed Belle, and thus she had 9 puppies. We decided to keep one of the puppies and name him, Baloo (like the bear from The Jungle Book). Being 8 years old with 9 golden retriever puppies was the best time of my life. That is also one of the main reasons that I am so madly in love with the breed.

		<h2> Bosko </h2>
		<p> Two years ago belle passed away, and Baloo passed away this past November. It was so hard not having a dog, and we missed our Goldens so much. So on January 1st 2017 we bought a golden retriever puppy. It was kind of an impulse decision but also the best decision we ever made. We named our new lil puppy boy Bosko. He is a whole lot different than Belle and Baloo. He has such a huge personality and he doesn't really listen to you... Ever. He doesn't come when you call his name; he comes when he wants to. But, nonetheless he is an amazing golden retriever.

		<h2> Best Breed in the World! </h2>
		<p> Golden Retrievers are more loyal, loving, and obviously the best looking breed in the game. I wouldn't trade my life and childhood of growing up with those loving dogs for anything. So if you are ever thinking of buying a dog, look no further than the kennel with the fluffy golden retrievers!
